This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to work with DICOM files using Python. You will start by learning how to install the necessary packages to work with DICOM files in Python. Then, you will dive into the fundamental concepts of working with DICOM files, including how to read and extract information from them, how to visualize them using libraries like PIL, and how to anonymize them.

The course will also cover various techniques for converting DICOM files to other image and video formats, such as PNG, JPG, and MP4, using libraries like OpenCV, ffmpeg, and dicom2nifti. By the end of this section, you will be able to apply these techniques to your own projects and work with DICOM files in a variety of formats.

Finally, the course will cover the backend of a DICOM viewer application built using the Tkinter library in Python. You will learn how to open and display DICOM files, including visualizing them in 2D, as well as how to extract and display information from DICOM files. By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in working with DICOM files using Python and will be able to build your own applications and projects that involve DICOM files.
