# PYCAD YouTube Series Code Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the PYCAD YouTube channel! This repository serves as a centralized hub where viewers can find the source code for all the tutorials, demonstrations, and educational content featured in our videos. Our goal is to make learning and replicating the projects from our videos as accessible and straightforward as possible.

## Repository Structure

Each video in the PYCAD YouTube series corresponds to a separate folder within this repository. These folders are named and organized according to the topic or specific video they represent, making it easy for you to navigate and find the code you're looking for.

### Folder Naming Convention

Folders are named following a consistent pattern to help you quickly identify the content:

[Video Publish Date] - [Video Title/Topic]


This naming convention ensures that you can easily match the repository's content with the videos on our YouTube channel.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Find the Video**: Start by locating the video you're interested in on the [PYCAD YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/pycad).
2. **Locate the Corresponding Folder**: Navigate to this repository and find the folder that matches the title or publish date of the video (and the link to the folder will be always in the video description).
3. **Explore the Code**: Inside the folder, you'll find all the code used in the video, along with any additional resources or instructions necessary to get started.
